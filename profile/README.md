# ABOUT US

**Openjournaltheme (OJT team)** was founded in 2016 and later uses the legal company name PT. Invovasi Informatik Sinergi. Our team initiated this company to help many publishers to be more focused on their content research rather than tackled by many technical OJS issues. We have served many both reputable publishers, small publishers, and non-commercial publishers. As our commitment to professionalism, we committed to give value to our work. 

This dedication resulted in satisfaction from our customers as you can check in this link. As we have throughout 4 years, we have brought our quality work to more than 400 publishers around the world and have been trusted by many publishers that implement our products or services. We are very grateful for this and this made possible because we believe in long-term relations, transparency, and focus to bring a positive impact on each of our work.

## Our commitment to Open Source 
Although our business is commercial based, we also believe that open source is good for everyone and that is why we are committed to bringing the value of open source to our customers. Until now we have provided several open sources products such as [Academic Free](https://openjournaltheme.com/academic-pro-ojs3-theme#academic-free) and [OJTDownloadFile](https://openjournaltheme.com/docs/how-to-install-ojtplugin).

We have also contributed to open source products such as [JatsParserPlugin](https://github.com/Vitaliy-1/JATSParserPlugin) & [pkp-lib](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib) We will continue to increase our contribution to PKP sources in the future with the optimism that we will have additional resources in this contribution process.
